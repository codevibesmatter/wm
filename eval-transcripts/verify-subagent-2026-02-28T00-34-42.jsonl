Execute a Verification Plan and fix any failures.\n\n## Your Role\n\n- Execute VP steps literally as written — commands, expected outcomes, all of it\n- Do NOT modify VP steps — they are the source of truth\n- Fix implementation code if VP steps fail (never the VP steps themselves)\n- Record all results as evidence and commit it\n\n## Input Sources\n\nVerify mode supports three input sources (checked in order):\n\n1. **Issue spec** — `kata enter verify --issue=N` extracts VP from the spec's `## Verification Plan`\n2. **Plan file** — reads `### VPn:` steps from a standalone markdown file\n3. **Infer** — builds VP from git diff + commit messages (build, tests, code review, intent matching)\n\n## Phase Flow\n\n```\nP0: Setup\n    ├── Determine VP input source (issue / plan-file / infer)\n    ├── Read verification-tools.md\n    └── Start dev server, confirm health\n\nP1: Execute (per VP step)\n    ├── Expand VP steps as individual tasks\n    ├── VP1: {step title}\n    ├── VP2: {step title}\n    └── ...VPn: {step title}\n\nP2: Fix Loop\n    ├── Check for failures from P1\n    └── For each failure: diagnose → fix → re-verify (max 3 cycles)\n\nP2-Review: Fix Review  (skip if no fixes were made)\n    ├── Check if fix commits exist\n    └── REVIEW Protocol: review-agent + external providers\n\nP3: Evidence\n    ├── Write VP evidence JSON\n    ├── Commit evidence + push\n    ├── Update GitHub issue (if issue-based)\n    └── Report pass/fail results\n```\n\n## VP Step Execution Protocol\n\nFor each VP step:\n\n1. **Read** the step instructions carefully — note commands AND expected outcomes\n2. **Execute** each command exactly as described — do not \"improve\" or skip commands\n3. **Compare** actual results to expected results — be precise, not approximate\n4. **Record** pass/fail with actual output captured\n\n### Rules\n\n- Execute commands EXACTLY as written in the VP\n- If a step requires the dev server, ensure it is running before executing\n- Record ALL results, even failures — do not stop on first failure, complete all steps\n- Never mark a step \"passed\" without actually running its commands\n\n## Repair-Reverify Loop (P2)\n\nIf any VP step fails in P1:\n\n1. **Diagnose** — read the error, identify the root cause in implementation code\n2. **Fix** — make the minimal code change to address the root cause\n3. **Re-run** — re-execute the failed VP step exactly as originally specified\n4. **Max 3 cycles** — if still failing after 3 repair attempts, record as permanently failed\n\n**Critical:** Fix the implementation, never the VP steps. VP steps encode what the feature\nis supposed to do — they are correct by definition in this mode.\n\n## REVIEW Protocol (P2-Review)\n\nAfter fixing VP failures, a focused code review guards against regressions introduced under\npressure. This phase runs **only when fix commits were made** — it is skipped when all VP\nsteps pass in P1.\n\n**Why this matters:** Emergency fixes during verification are high-risk. The pressure to get\nVP steps passing can lead to symptom-masking, scope creep, or fragile workarounds. The review\nspecifically targets hasty-fix failure modes rather than general code style.\n\n**Protocol:**\n\n1. **Spawn review-agent** — subagent reviews fix diff with hasty-fix criteria:\n   - Minimality (no scope creep)\n   - Root cause (not symptom masking)\n   - Regression risk (no collateral damage to other VP steps)\n   - Correctness (logic sound, edge cases handled)\n   - Side effects (no unintended state changes)\n2. **External providers** — run `kata review --prompt=verify-fix-review --provider=<name>` for\n   each configured reviewer (pre-expanded into the task title as `{reviewers}` at `kata enter` time)\n\n**If REQUEST CHANGES:** fix the issues, commit, and re-run the review.\n**If APPROVE:** proceed to P3 Evidence.\n\n## Stop Conditions\n\n- All VP steps executed and recorded\n- Fix loop complete (all passing or max cycles reached)\n- VP evidence file committed and pushed\n- Results reported with pass/fail verdict\n\n\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"mode\": \"verify\",\n  \"workflowId\": \"GH#100\",\n  \"action\": \"started\",\n  \"sessionType\": \"verify\",\n  \"template\": \"verify.md\",\n  \"phases\": [\n    \"p1\",\n    \"p2\"\n  ],\n  \"workflowDir\": \"/data/projects/kata-wm/eval-projects/verify-subagent-2026-02-28T00-34-42/.claude/sessions/582f5acb-464c-4bed-b307-0301a5b2529c/workflow\",\n  \"enteredAt\": \"2026-02-28T00:34:52.862Z\",\n  \"specPath\": \"/data/projects/kata-wm/eval-projects/verify-subagent-2026-02-28T00-34-42/planning/specs/100-health-endpoint.md\",\n  \"phasesFromSpec\": true,\n  \"issueNumber\": 100,\n  \"tasks\": [\n    \"GH#100: P0: Determine VP input source\",\n    \"GH#100: P0: Read verification tools config\",\n    \"GH#100: P0: Start dev server and confirm health\",\n    \"GH#100: P1: Expand VP steps as individual tasks\",\n    \"GH#100: P2: Check for VP failures\",\n    \"GH#100: P2: Fix implementation and re-verify (max 3 cycles)\",\n    \"GH#100: P2-REVIEW: Check if fixes were made during P2\",\n    \"GH#100: P2-REVIEW: Review fix changes — review-agent\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Write VP evidence file\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Commit evidence and push\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Update GitHub issue with verification results\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Report verification results\"\n  ],\n  \"guidance\": {\n    \"requiredTodos\": [\n      {\n        \"content\": \"P0: Setup -

Execute a Verification Plan and fix any failures.\n\n## Your Role\n\n- Execute VP steps literally as written — commands, expected outcomes, all of it\n- Do NOT modify VP steps — they are the source of truth\n- Fix implementation code if VP steps fail (never the VP steps themselves)\n- Record all results as evidence and commit it\n\n## Input Sources\n\nVerify mode supports three input sources (checked in order):\n\n1. **Issue spec** — `kata enter verify --issue=N` extracts VP from the spec's `## Verification Plan`\n2. **Plan file** — reads `### VPn:` steps from a standalone markdown file\n3. **Infer** — builds VP from git diff + commit messages (build, tests, code review, intent matching)\n\n## Phase Flow\n\n```\nP0: Setup\n    ├── Determine VP input source (issue / plan-file / infer)\n    ├── Read verification-tools.md\n    └── Start dev server, confirm health\n\nP1: Execute (per VP step)\n    ├── Expand VP steps as individual tasks\n    ├── VP1: {step title}\n    ├── VP2: {step title}\n    └── ...VPn: {step title}\n\nP2: Fix Loop\n    ├── Check for failures from P1\n    └── For each failure: diagnose → fix → re-verify (max 3 cycles)\n\nP2-Review: Fix Review  (skip if no fixes were made)\n    ├── Check if fix commits exist\n    └── REVIEW Protocol: review-agent + external providers\n\nP3: Evidence\n    ├── Write VP evidence JSON\n    ├── Commit evidence + push\n    ├── Update GitHub issue (if issue-based)\n    └── Report pass/fail results\n```\n\n## VP Step Execution Protocol\n\nFor each VP step:\n\n1. **Read** the step instructions carefully — note commands AND expected outcomes\n2. **Execute** each command exactly as described — do not \"improve\" or skip commands\n3. **Compare** actual results to expected results — be precise, not approximate\n4. **Record** pass/fail with actual output captured\n\n### Rules\n\n- Execute commands EXACTLY as written in the VP\n- If a step requires the dev server, ensure it is running before executing\n- Record ALL results, even failures — do not stop on first failure, complete all steps\n- Never mark a step \"passed\" without actually running its commands\n\n## Repair-Reverify Loop (P2)\n\nIf any VP step fails in P1:\n\n1. **Diagnose** — read the error, identify the root cause in implementation code\n2. **Fix** — make the minimal code change to address the root cause\n3. **Re-run** — re-execute the failed VP step exactly as originally specified\n4. **Max 3 cycles** — if still failing after 3 repair attempts, record as permanently failed\n\n**Critical:** Fix the implementation, never the VP steps. VP steps encode what the feature\nis supposed to do — they are correct by definition in this mode.\n\n## REVIEW Protocol (P2-Review)\n\nAfter fixing VP failures, a focused code review guards against regressions introduced under\npressure. This phase runs **only when fix commits were made** — it is skipped when all VP\nsteps pass in P1.\n\n**Why this matters:** Emergency fixes during verification are high-risk. The pressure to get\nVP steps passing can lead to symptom-masking, scope creep, or fragile workarounds. The review\nspecifically targets hasty-fix failure modes rather than general code style.\n\n**Protocol:**\n\n1. **Spawn review-agent** — subagent reviews fix diff with hasty-fix criteria:\n   - Minimality (no scope creep)\n   - Root cause (not symptom masking)\n   - Regression risk (no collateral damage to other VP steps)\n   - Correctness (logic sound, edge cases handled)\n   - Side effects (no unintended state changes)\n2. **External providers** — run `kata review --prompt=verify-fix-review --provider=<name>` for\n   each configured reviewer (pre-expanded into the task title as `{reviewers}` at `kata enter` time)\n\n**If REQUEST CHANGES:** fix the issues, commit, and re-run the review.\n**If APPROVE:** proceed to P3 Evidence.\n\n## Stop Conditions\n\n- All VP steps executed and recorded\n- Fix loop complete (all passing or max cycles reached)\n- VP evidence file committed and pushed\n- Results reported with pass/fail verdict\n\n\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"mode\": \"verify\",\n  \"workflowId\": \"GH#100\",\n  \"action\": \"started\",\n  \"sessionType\": \"verify\",\n  \"template\": \"verify.md\",\n  \"phases\": [\n    \"p1\",\n    \"p2\"\n  ],\n  \"workflowDir\": \"/data/projects/kata-wm/eval-projects/verify-subagent-2026-02-28T00-34-42/.claude/sessions/582f5acb-464c-4bed-b307-0301a5b2529c/workflow\",\n  \"enteredAt\": \"2026-02-28T00:34:52.862Z\",\n  \"specPath\": \"/data/projects/kata-wm/eval-projects/verify-subagent-2026-02-28T00-34-42/planning/specs/100-health-endpoint.md\",\n  \"phasesFromSpec\": true,\n  \"issueNumber\": 100,\n  \"tasks\": [\n    \"GH#100: P0: Determine VP input source\",\n    \"GH#100: P0: Read verification tools config\",\n    \"GH#100: P0: Start dev server and confirm health\",\n    \"GH#100: P1: Expand VP steps as individual tasks\",\n    \"GH#100: P2: Check for VP failures\",\n    \"GH#100: P2: Fix implementation and re-verify (max 3 cycles)\",\n    \"GH#100: P2-REVIEW: Check if fixes were made during P2\",\n    \"GH#100: P2-REVIEW: Review fix changes — review-agent\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Write VP evidence file\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Commit evidence and push\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Update GitHub issue with verification results\",\n    \"GH#100: P3: Report verification results\"\n  ],\n  \"guidance\": {\n    \"requiredTodos\": [\n      {\n        \"content\": \"P0: Setup - determine VP source, read verification tools, prepare environment\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"activeForm\": \"P0: Setup - determine VP source, read verification tools, prepare environment\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"content\": \"P2: Fix Loop - repair failures and re-verify\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"activeForm\": \"P2: Fix Loop - repair failures and re-verify\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"content\": \"P2-Review: Fix Review - review emergency fixes for regressions before committing evidence\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"activeForm\": \"P2-Review: Fix Review - review emergency fixes for regressions before committing evidence\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"content\": \"P3: Evidence - write VP evidence, commit, report results\",\n        \"status\": \"pending\",\n        \"activeForm\": \"P3: Evidence - write VP evidence, commit, report results\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"workflow\": [\n      \"Follow the tasks closely - they define your workflow.\",\n      \"Reference template: packages/workflow-management/templates/verify.md\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Commands:\",\n      \"  kata status                           # Check current mode and phase\",\n      \"  kata can-exit                         # Check if exit conditions met\"\n    ],\n    \"taskSystem\": [],\n    \"commands\": {\n      \"listTasks\": \"kata status\",\n      \"pendingTasks\": \"kata can-exit\",\n      \"completeWithEvidence\": \"TaskUpdate(taskId=\\\"X\\\", status=\\\"completed\\\")\"\n    }\n  }\n}","stderr":"","interrupted":false,"isImage":false,"noOutputExpected":false}}
