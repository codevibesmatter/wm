        instruction: |
          Write the spec body following this structure:

          ## Overview
          1-3 sentences: what problem this solves, for whom, and why now.

          ## Feature Behaviors

          For each behavior:
          ```
          ### B{N}: {Behavior Name}
          **Core:**
          - **ID:** {kebab-case-id}
          - **Trigger:** {what causes this}
          - **Expected:** {what should happen}
          - **Verify:** {how to confirm it works}

          **UI Layer:** {what the user sees}
          **API Layer:** {endpoint, input, output}
          **Data Layer:** {schema changes, if any}
          ```

          ## Non-Goals
          Explicit list of what this feature does NOT do.

          ## Implementation Phases
          Break into 2-5 phases (p1, p2...) with concrete tasks per phase.
          Phases go in the YAML frontmatter `phases:` array.

          Then: Mark this task completed via TaskUpdate

      - id: link-github-issue
        title: "Create or link GitHub issue"
        instruction: |
          **If issue exists:** Update the `github_issue:` frontmatter field.
          Mark it as spec-in-progress:
          ```bash
          gh issue edit {N} --remove-label "status:todo" --add-label "status:in-progress" --add-label "needs-spec"
          ```

          **If creating new issue:**
          ```bash
          gh issue create \
            --title "{feature title}" \
            --body "$(cat planning/specs/{spec-file}.md | head -50)" \
            --label "feature" \
            --label "status:in-progress" \
            --label "needs-spec"
          ```
          Note the issue number. Update spec frontmatter `github_issue:` field.
          Update spec filename to include issue number: `{N}-{slug}.md`

          **If skipping:** Leave `github_issue: null`

    steps:
      - id: completeness-check
        title: "Check spec completeness"
        instruction: |
          Review spec against this checklist:
          - [ ] All behaviors have ID, Trigger, Expected, Verify
          - [ ] No placeholder text (TODO, TBD, {variable} left unfilled)
          - [ ] File paths in spec actually exist (or will be created)
          - [ ] Implementation phases cover all behaviors
          - [ ] Non-goals section present
          - [ ] GitHub issue linked (or explicitly skipped)

          Fix any gaps found.

      - id: spawn-review-agent
        title: "Spawn spec review agent"

          ```bash
          gh issue edit {N} --remove-label "needs-spec" --add-label "needs-review"
          ```

          Spawn a review agent to give a second opinion:

          Task(subagent_type="spec-writer", prompt="
            Review this spec for completeness and correctness:
            Read: planning/specs/{spec-file}.md

            Check:
            1. Are behaviors clear and testable?
            2. Are phases realistic (not too large or small)?
            3. Missing edge cases?
            4. Ambiguous requirements?

            Output: numbered list of issues (or 'LGTM' if clean)
          ", run_in_background=false)

          Address any issues raised.
