          **IN scope:**
          - {what to explore}

          **OUT of scope:**
          - {what to skip even if interesting}

          **Time limit:** Set a rough budget (e.g. "30 min codebase, 15 min external").
          Research expands indefinitely without boundaries.

# Research Mode

Deep exploration with parallel agent search and documented findings.

## Phase Flow

```
P0: Clarify (required)     → understand what to research
P1: Scope (required)       → define questions + success criteria
P2: Codebase (optional)    → parallel Explore agents
P3: External (optional)    → web search + documentation
P4: Synthesize (required)  → compile findings + write research doc
P5: Present (required)     → share results + decide next step
```

## Output

- Research doc: `{research_path}/{date}-{slug}.md` (configurable in wm.yaml)
- Structured findings with sources
- Ranked recommendations
- Next steps (none, planning, more research)
