/**
 * Planning Review Agents — review-agent + gemini + codex spawn simultaneously in P3
 *
 * Tests that the P3 spec review step spawns all three reviewers in a single parallel
 * message (run_in_background=true) rather than running them sequentially.
 *
 * Uses tanstack-start fixture with:
 * - A pre-seeded spec at planning/specs/200-dark-mode.md (status: needs-review)
 * - spec_reviewers: [gemini, codex] added to kata.yaml
 *
 * The agent picks up the spec at needs-review status and runs P3 directly,
 * bypassing P0-P2 interview/research/writing phases.
 *
 * Asserts:
 * 1. Standard planning workflow checks (mode, commit, clean tree, can-exit, spec approved)
 * 2. review-agent spawned (transcript contains "review-agent")
 * 3. gemini spec review ran (transcript contains "--provider=gemini")
 * 4. codex spec review ran (transcript contains "--provider=codex")
 * 5. Reviewers were spawned with run_in_background (transcript contains "run_in_background")
